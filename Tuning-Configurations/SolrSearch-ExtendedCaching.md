# Solr Search - Extended Caching Configurations

## Solr REST Caching (9.1.12+)

The Solr Search Server container includes a sample `cachespec.xml` file that contains REST caching configurations for Emerald/B2C.
Implement the extended caching by merging the caching rules from `/profile/apps/search-ear.ear/search-rest.war/WEB-INF/cachespec.xml.rest.sample` into the search-rest.war `cachespec.xml` location: `/profile/apps/search-ear.ear/search-rest.war/WEB-INF/cachespec.xml`.
